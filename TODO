This document describes future features to be implemented in XMvn.

To request a new feature contact the author on IRC (mizdebsk @
#fedora-java @ FreeNode), send an email to mizdebsk@redhat.com or
submit a RFE at Red Hat Bugzilla (product Fedora, component xmvn):
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=fedora&component=xmvn


* Random ideas (no milestone assigned)

** plugin API

** XMvn Subst improvements

*** dry run
    don't actually replace any JARs, but report what would have been
    replaced

*** strict mode
    if any JAR can't be substituted, bail out

*** check run
    verify correctness of existing symlinks


* Deferred features

** improved configuration

*** final fields
    some configuration settings cannot be overridden by offspring
    configuration files

*** configuration from pluginManagement
    just like Eclipse M2E does

*** singleton configurator
    configurator should generate configuration once and cache it

*** in tests don't modify configuration directly
    clone it and customize the clone

** improve compat package resolver
   maybe version ranges, maybe number of matching components
