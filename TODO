* Milestone 0.6.0

** improved configuration

*** final fields
    some configuration settings cannot be overridden by offspring
    configuration files

*** configuration from pluginManagement
    just like Eclipse M2E does

*** singleton configurator
    configurator should generate configuration once and cache it

*** in tests don't modify configuration directly
    clone it and customize the clone


* Milestone 1.0.0

** distinguish between public API and private implementation

** plugin API

** allow installing artifacts without building them
   like package is built with ant, pom.xml cannot be used to build it,
   but still pom.xml and jar files should be installable

** SCL support
   wrt auto requires generator

** usability in Debian
   working basic debhelper or CDBS integration

** fix builddep MOJO
   verify if generated BuildRequires are correct and complete; make
   builddep mojo print the list BuildRequires on stdout (so it gets
   included in mock build.log).  Especially verify profile activation.

** improve compat package resolver
   maybe version ranges, maybe number of matching components


* Random ideas (no milestone assigned)

** add support for classifiers and stereotypes
