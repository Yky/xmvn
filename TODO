* support backreferences in regex replacements (very useful for
  multi-artifact packages like jetty, maven-surefire)

* bail out if any rule (except default) is never successfully matched

* support compat packages (in resolver loop over the same depmaps,
  don't override identical depmaps; this blocks jboss-as transition)

* fix builddep mojo (verify if generated BuildRequires are correct and
  complete)

* make builddep mojo print the list BuildRequires on stdout (so it
  gets included in mock build.log)

* SCL support ?? (wrt auto requires generator)

* improve compat package resolver (maybe version ranges, maybe number
  of matching components)

* externalize (don't hardcode) launcher Plexus Classworlds config for
  xmvn-launcher

* eliminate warnings about missing plugins versions

* make installed sumlinks relative (instead of absolute)

* don't rely on JPP symlinks when resolving artifacts
