This document describes future features to be implemented in XMvn.

To request a new feature contact the author on IRC (mizdebsk @

submit a RFE at Red Hat Bugzilla (product Fedora, component xmvn):

* Milestone 0.4.0

** improved configuration

*** XML configuration
    instead of system properties and environmental variables

*** Modello based
    supports model versions; can generate documentation; it's the
    "Maven way", used by other Maven components

*** configuration inheritance

*** final fields
    some configuration settings cannot be overridden by offspring
    configuration files

*** configuration from pluginManagement
    just like Eclipse M2E does

*** in configuration model use Boolean instead of String when possible
    String was used as a workaround for [MODELLO-267]

*** singleton configurator
    configurator should generate configuration once and cache it

*** implement clone() of configuration model
    it should be possible to create a deep clone of full configuration
    to play with it without affecting global settings

*** in tests don't modify configuration directly
    clone it and customize the clone

*** document all custom configuration options

*** add more configuration options
    how auto-requires are generated and whether effective POM should be
    installed or not

** improved Plexus Classworlds configuration

*** externalize config for xmvn-launcher
    Plexus Classworlds launcher config ought to be extracted as a
    separate file, not hardcoded in source files

*** set and use xmvn.home system property
    this is needed to improve maven-invoker usage

** new site

*** automatically generated
    maven-site-plugin

*** automatically deployable
    SCP to fedorapeople.org (wagon needs fixing)


* Milestone 1.0.0

** distinguish between public API and private implementation

** plugin API

** allow installing artifacts without building them
   like package is built with ant, pom.xml cannot be used to build it,
   but still pom.xml and jar files should be installable

** SCL support
   wrt auto requires generator

** usability in Debian
   working basic debhelper or CDBS integration

** fix builddep MOJO
   verify if generated BuildRequires are correct and complete; make
   builddep mojo print the list BuildRequires on stdout (so it gets
   included in mock build.log)

** improve compat package resolver
   maybe version ranges, maybe number of matching components


* Random ideas (no milestone assigned)

** bail out if any rule (except default) is never successfully matched

** eliminate warnings about missing plugins versions

** build-classpath and build-jar-repository

** better handle inter-subpackage dependencies
   versioned deps, dependency graphs etc.
