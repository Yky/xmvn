* bail out if any rule (except default) is never successfully matched

* fix builddep mojo (verify if generated BuildRequires are correct and
  complete)

* make builddep mojo print the list BuildRequires on stdout (so it
  gets included in mock build.log)

* SCL support ?? (wrt auto requires generator)

* improve compat package resolver (maybe version ranges, maybe number
  of matching components)

* externalize (don't hardcode) launcher Plexus Classworlds config for
  xmvn-launcher

* eliminate warnings about missing plugins versions

* don't rely on JPP symlinks when resolving artifacts

* build-classpath and build-jar-repository

* document all custom configuration options

* better handle inter-subpackage dependencies (versioned deps,
  dependency graphs etc.)

* allow installing artifacts without building them (like package is
  built with ant, pom.xml cannot be used to build it, but still
  pom.xml and jar files should be installable)
